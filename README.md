# asthma_attack_prediction

Dataset contains health information of patients’ diagnosis with Asthma.

It includes demographic details, lifestyle factors, environmental and allergy factors, medical history, clinical measurements and symptoms.

Modelling objective: To build a machine learning model to predict factors associated with asthma attacks.

Target variable: Diagnosis (‘Yes’ or ‘No’)

Oversampling via SMOTE is done as target variable is imbalanced
	
Gradient Boost classifier achieved the highest accuracy at 94%.

Predictors of asthma attack: 1) Chest_tightness, 2) Exercise_induced, 3) Shortness_of_Breath.
