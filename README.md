Coronary Artery disease prediction

Dataset contains medical records of patientsâ€™ diagnosis with coronary artery disease for a hospital .

It includes demographics information, medical history, clinical measurements and symptoms.

Modelling objective: To build a machine learning model to predict factors associated with Coronary artery diesease.

Target variable: Survive (1 or 0)

As dataset is imbalanced, AUC scores are used to decide on the accuracy of the Prediction model

Random Forest Classifier model: AUC = 0.985, it is selected as the final model for prediction

Predictors for Coronary Artery diseases in patients are 1) Creatinine, 2) Weight, 3) Pet Allery, 4) Creatine phosphokinase,

5) Age
